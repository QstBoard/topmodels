# {{ project_name }}

## Introduction

Welcome to the `{{ project_name }}` project. 
This repository provides a robust and scalable foundation for data science and machine learning workflows. 
It is designed to help teams structure their code, configuration, and data assets efficiently, 
ensuring reproducibility and collaboration across different environments.

## Context

This template is intended for use in data science projects that require clear separation 
between development, acceptance, and production environments. 
It includes best practices for configuration management, modular code organization, and version control. 
The structure is suitable for projects involving data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure

- `config/`  
  Contains configuration files for different environments:
  - `base.py`: Base configuration shared by all environments.
  - `dev.py`: Development-specific configuration.
- `notebook/`  
  Directory for Jupyter notebooks and exploratory analyses.

## Releases
